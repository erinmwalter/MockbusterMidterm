# MockbusterMidterm

DevBuild midterm C# OOP console app.

Task was to make a "Mockbuster" Console app where a user could see movies, search by title, genre, main actors, or director,
and could add and delete movies from their favorites list.

Also added in a log-in and logout functionality, as well as a regular user login and an admin login functionality.
